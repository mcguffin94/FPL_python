## process: how we came to this line-up

### defenders

To pick defenders, we used these filters:
```
fpl_defenders = fpl_defenders.loc[(mrg_mid["90s"] > 4)]
fpl_defenders = fpl_defenders.loc[(mrg_mid["SCA90"] > 1.5)]
```

Our hypothesis was that SCA is direct indicator of possible attacking return, more the shot creating action, more the return. But as you can see in the chart below, SCA was not the direct indicator of possible attacking return.
