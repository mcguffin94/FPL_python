## Anticipating based on my football experiences.

I've been following Premier League since 2006. I was in 6th grade, and Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson was the team that captivated my young soul. Manchester United style of football became the norm of stylish football for me. Fast attacking football and clinical striker up top, who can score 20 goals easily in one season.

And seasons changed, everybody were still chanting Manchester United. I kinda got bored of that shit, why follow everybody's team? Maybe I'll dig another team. And Chelsea stood out as Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard played some beautiful football in that time. Especially Drogba, everyone in my school was doing that arm stretching celebration after they scored a goal. 

I didn't know much about football then, I just followed team that played attractive football.
